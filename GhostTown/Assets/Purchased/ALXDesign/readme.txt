Asset Tornado

Realistic tornado with physical interaction with objects.
As a result of collision, any object with a rigidbody will be picked up and wrapped by this tornado.
If a prefab with a tornado is placed in the game world and launched along a prepared trajectory, it will destroy all physical objects in its path.
You can approach the tornado yourself and be carried away into the clouds.
All parameters in scripts are adjustable. Everything is simple and intuitive.


For use:
Just add prefabs Tornado to your project and adjust their sizes and other parameters, if necessary.
